Excitement Level Key
3 - Soo excited
2 - I will like it
1 - not expecting much

How do I want this app to work even?

On page load...

-   list of all recipe cards
-   filter thru recipes by
    -   season
    -   type
    -   have_made
    -   excitement level
    -   (one day: by ingredients & complexity(will have to determine my own formula for complexity taking time/difficulty/# of sub-recipes involved))

When on card...

-   get taken to detail page
    -   name
    -   season
    -   type
    -   have_made (with option to edit)
    -   div comment section

1. Use Bulletin Board for functionality
2. Use Countries
